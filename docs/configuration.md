# Configuration

Use the checked-in environment examples as the mechanical configuration
reference:

- `.env.example` for local development and the Mac helper;
- `.env.production.example` for the hosted Discord service; and
- `.env.worker.example` for the headless Codex worker.

Defaults enforced by an image or installer live in `Dockerfile.worker` and
`scripts/mac-agent.mjs`. This document records the boundaries and security
decisions that are not obvious from those files. Setup and deployment procedures
live in [operations.md](operations.md).

The Mac installer reads `.env.local`; the headless worker reads `.env.worker`.

## Discord boundaries

`DISCORD_GUILD_ID` selects the only guild allowed to use the channel access
panel, role commands, and scheduled posts. Its fallback and the built-in
Wordle/Brawl Stars `SELF_ASSIGNABLE_ROLES` target WM31; they are deployment data,
not portable examples. Change both values together when moving or repurposing
those features. Every scheduled-post destination must belong to the configured
guild.

Chatbot authorization is independent. Configure its sole owner, allowed guilds,
and optional channel exceptions with the `MINISAGO_CHATBOT_*` variables. Every
value is validated as a Discord snowflake. The service and workers fail closed
when the owner is missing or malformed; empty guild and channel lists grant no
community access. The hosted service and every worker must use the same owner
ID.

Ambient reactions are opt-in and use the same guild/channel community
boundaries. Fresh human messages first enter an in-memory notification buffer
without calling a model. MiniSago occasionally schedules one delayed attention
check for a conversation burst, then either ignores the batch or reacts to at
most one candidate message. The probability and hard hourly model-call ceiling
are configurable; the defaults notice 25% of eligible bursts and permit at most
four checks per hour. Unsolicited replies remain disabled.

The hosted service verifies the bot's effective channel permissions, advertises
available custom emoji through the bounded reaction capability, validates the
selected message and emoji, and applies channel, member, and hourly reaction
cooldowns before calling Discord. Ambient planning does not download
attachments. The Discord token never leaves the hosted service.

Mention answers use the same host-owned reaction broker and emoji inventory.
One answer inference can choose a reply, a reaction bound to the triggering
message, or both; it does not require a second reaction-planning model call.

The checked-in deployment still hardcodes:

- configured-guild fallback `1282936453134815275`;
- WM31 Wordle role `1451976411152781466` and Brawl Stars role
  `1450774352386719775`; and
- PR review repository and reviewer mapping for `Hsiii/health-check-system`.

A general self-host must change these remaining source-level boundaries or
disable the corresponding features. Installing the bot in another guild does
not expose the WM31 controls or scheduled feeds there.

Gateway features are enabled when a bot token is present unless
`DISCORD_GATEWAY_DISABLED=true`. Run only one Gateway-enabled instance per bot
token; use the disabled setting for local or temporary HTTP-only instances while
production is connected.

## Worker trust boundary

The hosted broker has separate worker profiles:

- `MINISAGO_WORKER_BRIDGE_SECRET` authenticates the server-owned `oracle`
  `chat,dev` worker; and
- `MINISAGO_MAC_BRIDGE_SECRET` authenticates a worker advertising `mac`.

Use independent random secrets of at least 32 bytes. The broker binds the cloud
secret to its server-owned identity and capabilities, and accepts the Mac secret
only from a worker advertising `mac`.

Workers advertise capacity, capabilities, and priority. The broker selects the
highest-priority compatible worker, falls back when it is unavailable or full,
and keeps all stages of a workflow on the selected worker. Only requests that
explicitly need a resource on Hsi's Mac may target `mac`.

Community and owner chat jobs run on GPT-5.6 Luna with high reasoning. Owner
requests first use Luna with low reasoning to select `chat` or `dev`; development
jobs then use GPT-5.6 Sol with medium reasoning. Mac targeting is an independent
decision. These profiles are part of the security and capability boundary, not
just quality preferences.

The Mac installer consumes `.env.local`. It creates an isolated Codex home that
links the existing `~/.codex/auth.json` but does not load normal Codex
configuration, skills, memories, plugins, user-configured MCP servers, or
repository instructions. Answer jobs receive only MiniSago's curated MCP server
with an opaque per-request bearer token. The server binds requester identity,
guild, channel permissions, and available actions outside model-controlled
arguments, expires the token after 16 minutes, and revokes it when the workflow
ends.

The trace database is owner-readable, expires entries after 14 days, and prunes
oldest entries above 250 MB. When a user asks about a previous answer, the
`get_previous_trace` MCP tool returns bounded observable metadata from the same
channel without exposing private chain-of-thought.

## Owner development and GitHub

Only owner requests enter the development and Mac execution router. The worker
then rechecks the requester's declared capabilities before Codex runs;
authorization does not depend on matching request phrases. Community jobs and
ordinary chat cannot execute developer commands. Owner development jobs receive
only a selected disposable repository checkout.

GitHub access uses a dedicated persistent `gh` login; MiniSago does not accept,
copy, or inject its token through environment variables. A worker may accept a
development job only for an exact repository advertised in
`MINISAGO_GITHUB_REPOSITORIES`. Advertisement means the worker may clone or
reuse that repository on demand; it does not need to be cloned in advance.
Set `MINISAGO_CHATBOT_REPOSITORY` when a worker advertises multiple repositories
so behavioral-change requests can be routed without repository-name heuristics.

Use one fine-grained credential limited to those repositories. It may receive
repository contents, issues, and pull-request write access, with read access to
checks and Actions when needed. Do not grant administration, secrets,
environments, deployments, organization, or unrelated-repository access.

The router may propose an `issue`, `code`, or `deploy` mutation only from the
owner's current request. It does not grant permission. MiniSago posts a
single-use confirmation button that expires after ten minutes and accepts only
Hsi's Discord account; pressing it binds the selected repository and scope to
the resumed job. Per-job wrappers enforce that scope, require draft pull
requests, and reject merge, ready, protected-branch, and force-push operations
through normal command paths. GitHub rulesets must also block direct and force
pushes to protected branches; Hsi remains responsible for merging. Repository
content and command output remain untrusted data.
Credential and ruleset setup is tracked in
[issue #12](https://github.com/Hsiii/mini-sago/issues/12).

## Persistent state

The PR review bridge and scheduled monitors use state files for idempotency.
Local defaults live under `.data`; production paths must live under `/app/state`
on the persistent `sago_cloud_bot-core-state` volume. The relevant variables
are:

- `GITHUB_PR_THREAD_STATE_FILE`
- `TOEFL_VOCAB_STATE_FILE`
- `GAMER_FORUM_STATE_FILE`
- `X_POST_STATE_FILE`

Do not place these files on the container's ephemeral filesystem in production.
